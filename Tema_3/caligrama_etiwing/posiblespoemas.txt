Poema 1
n a world where nature's beauty lies,
Where vibrant colors paint the skies,
I weave a poem, free from deceit,
To honor the Earth, our sacred retreat.

Oh, Mother Nature, with grace untold,
Your secrets and wonders, yet unfold,
From lofty mountains to oceans deep,
In your embrace, eternal treasures keep.

Through lush green forests, rivers flow,
A symphony of life, where creatures grow,
The delicate balance, a fragile dance,
Let's cherish your gifts, give them a chance.

Let us stand as guardians of the land,
With tender hearts and helping hand,
Protect the air we breathe each day,
And cleanse the oceans where life holds sway.

No more greed or reckless desire,
Let's quench our thirst from a different fire,
Sustainable choices, let them guide,
Preserving the Earth, side by side.

For in this delicate cosmic design,
We're but visitors passing through time,
So let our legacy be one of care,
A testament of love we gladly share.

In harmony with nature, let us dwell,
With every step, our actions tell,
A story of reverence, a tale of worth,
A pledge to nurture, protect the Earth.

For in her embrace, we find our place,
Her grace and beauty, a saving grace,
Let this poem stand as a heartfelt plea,
To safeguard our home, our sanctuary.

Poema 2
Pachamama, mother earth,
Blessed with beauty and worth,
Nurturing all life with care,
A symbol of love beyond compare.
 
From the mountains to the sea,
Your presence is felt, wild and free,
In every tree, flower, and breeze,
Your spirit dances with such ease.
 
With every breath, we feel your love,
A gentle reminder from above,
That we are all connected, one and the same,
Bound together in this cosmic game.
 
Your rivers flow with ancient wisdom,
A source of life, a sacred rhythm,
Your soil rich with stories untold,
A treasure trove of secrets to unfold.
 
Pachamama, your beauty knows no end,
In every corner, around every bend,
Your colors, your textures, your endless grace,
A masterpiece of nature, a heavenly embrace.
 
But as we take, we must give back,
For our actions can leave a lasting crack,
On your fragile surface, we must tread with care,
For you are precious, beyond compare.
 
Let us honor you, Pachamama,
With every step, with every drama,
For you are the source of all we know,
Our sustenance, our love, our eternal flow.
 
So let us sing your praises high,
And dance under your vast blue sky,
For you are the heart of all creation,
Pachamama, our eternal salvation.
